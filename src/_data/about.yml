- My name is Sam Green and I'm a full-stack developer with 5 years of experience. 
  I've spent the majority of my career as a Ruby on Rails developer at a small, fast-paced start-up 
  company. In that time I've had the fortune of getting my hands on every part of a product - including
  front-end and back-end development, managing infrastructure, acting as the Scrum Master and leading
  direction of the product. I've also had the opportunity to lead a development team both technically
  and as a manager.

- Working in a fast-paced environment has led me to make many, many mistakes - but importantly I have
  learned how to fix and avoid those mistakes. I am passionate about writing testable, extensible code and
  helping junior engineers understand the importance of doing the same. As a developer who was given a chance as a
  junior to learn on the job I am always looking to pay it forward and share my experiences in any way that
  is helpful.

- I am driven by a desire to solve interesting problems (+1 if for a good cause) in a simple way that strikes
  a balance between elegant and realistic. I like to view myself as a Software Practitioner that can use whatever
  tool is required for the job, whether it be a new language or new framework. With that being said I have a love
  for Ruby on Rails that keeps me always coming back!
